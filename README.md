# Statistical Comparison of Valence-Arousal Classifiers from EEG on DEAP and MANHOB Datasets

This repository contains pretrained models, code and a report about a statistical study on different valence-arousal classifiers from EEG (Electroencephalography) signals on [DEAP](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) and [MAHNOB](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/) datasets.

The [report](./report.pdf) compares two classifiers (a deep neural network and a convolutional neural network) against DEAP and MAHNOB, and evaluates if there is a significant difference in performance between the two methods using some statistical tests (like McNemar's test and 5x2cv test).
